\section{NSF grant proposal}
\bjb{%
I am currently thinking that the NSF grant proposal should focus on (or at least start with) the publications mentioned above tagged with \cmg{nsf}.
These publications are the most concrete and lean towards machine learning and computational linguistics more than philosophy of science.
The general idea, then would be that the non-NSF papers would be completed primarily before the NSF grant kicks in.%

\noindent\textbf{Title}\quad Benchmarking the Quality of Emergent Language

\paragraph{Proposed Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data-driven metric of how ``human-like'' an emergent language is
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Semantics-augmented emergent language comparison
        \end{itemize}
    \item Linguistic feature-focused metric of how ``human-like'' an emergent language is
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Does linguistic proximity between a human and emergent language correlate with pretraining quality?
        \item Do surface features or underlying semantics matter more for pretraining?
        \end{itemize}
    \item Case study in methods of engineering; possibly an emergent language benchmark
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Broader Impact}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cmg{direct} Assist researchers in emergent language
    \item \cmg{direct} Learn about inductive biases of neural networks?
    \item \cmg{direct} Measure the understandability of natural communication in multi-agent systems?
    \item \cmg{indirect} Alternative data source for low-resource language
    \item \cmg{indirect} Alternative multimodal data source
\end{itemize}
