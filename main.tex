\title{The Structure of the Emergent Language Revolution}


% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\section{NSF grant proposal}
\bjb{%
I am currently thinking that the NSF grant proposal should focus on (or at least start with) the publications mentioned above tagged with \cmg{nsf}.
These publications are the most concrete and lean towards machine learning and computational linguistics more than philosophy of science.
The general idea, then would be that the non-NSF papers would be completed primarily before the NSF grant kicks in.%

\chapter{The Emergent Language Revolution}
\section{What emergent language is}
Emergent language is the study of simulations of how language arises \emph{de novo}.
This is distinguished from two related topics: the evolution of language and computational models of diachronic language change.
The former is similar in subject matter, the origin of language, but relies on different methods such as the comparative method, animal psychology, or anthropology.
The latter is similar in its methods, simulations and computational models, but typically looks at language change starting with a fully-fledged human language rather than starting from nothing.
The combination these topics and techniques make emergent language its own distinct field with unique goals and challenges.

This field lives also under the names ``language emergence'' and ``emergent communication.''
The former name is simply less common, but the latter implies a slightly different subject matter.
Although, speaking of ``communication'' avoids the philosophical mire of precisely what makes a language, speaking of ``language'' better emphasizes the fact that the distinctly human phenomenon of language is what the field mostly cares about.
For this reason, we will favor ``emergent language'' in this work.
