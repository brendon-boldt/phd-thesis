- PhD direction
    - A little bit of everything to illustrate the potential structure in ELR?
    - Alternatively, focus on making more significant progress on one topic within ELR.
        - Evaluating the complexity of emergent language based on cycle-consistent MT
        - Evaluating the complexity of EL via some abstract metric
        - Philosophy of emergence and defining what is emergence.
            - I don't think this is the best path because I believe that what is or is not emergent be pragmatically defined by whatever advances there are in EL
- Potential papers for PhD
    * Sketching a path for emergent language research, broadly speaking
    * Introducing a theoretical model
    - Testing a theoretical model in a fully scientific way
    - Formalizing the task of "approximating human language"
    - Applying emergent language to a downstream task
    - Using a downstream task as an extrinsic measure of performance
    - Creating an abstraction for emergent language environments
        - Moving from "realistic" environments to abstract characterizations
        - Although you did not have this in mind, this seems to be an necessary step of formulating a theoretical model
        - The more broad-reaching the theory, the more the model abstracts from the particulars
- Papers for topic: Automated evaluation of emergent language proximity to human language
    - Characterizing what levels of similarity are needed for different applications/goals of emergent language
    - Extrinsic evaluation via MT pretraining vis-a-vis synthetic languages
    - Formalizing the task of "approximating human language"
        - Syntax
        - Semantics
        - Pragmatics, function
    - Something interlingua, unsupervised MT, and aligning vector spaces
    - Comparing embedding spaces with persistent homology:
